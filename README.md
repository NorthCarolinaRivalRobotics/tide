# Tide - A robotics framework for those who like to build

Our goal with building tide is to create a system that makes it easy to build robust, practical, and performant robotics applications.  It is opinionated towards mobile robotics systems but could be adapted to serve usecases involving stationary arms.

Tide uses Zenoh for pub / sub for easy setup and configuration 

Tide uses a UUID based naming system for robots to fascilitate multi-agent systems.

While not yet implemented, tide theoretically could with ROS 2 via https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-ros2dds

Tide uses UV meaning it is easy to run.
